Welcome to **notestack.dev** 👋

This site was born out of a simple habit... taking notes while building, breaking, fixing, and rebuilding my homelab and home IoT. Over time, those notes started to look more like step-by-step guides so I decided to organize them and make them public.

I work as a **Cloud Operations Engineer**, with a background in telecommunications and cloud infrastructure.
At home, my homelab is where I experiment, learn, and validate ideas.
If something here exists, it’s because I needed it, tested it, or broke it at least once.

The goal of this site is straightforward:
- Document **how to install, configure, and run** the tools I actually use.
- Keep notes practical, reproducible, and opinionated (when needed).
- Serve as both my personal knowledge base and a reference for others on a similar path.

If you find something useful here, great! That’s exactly the point.
