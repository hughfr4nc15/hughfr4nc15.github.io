# notestack.dev

Welcome to **notestack.dev** — a practical knowledge base documenting homelab setup, scripts, home IoT and hands-on tech guides.

## 📖 About This Project

This repository contains the source for [notestack.dev](https://notestack.dev), a personal knowledge base born from experimenting, breaking, and rebuilding a homelab. What started as simple notes evolved into step-by-step guides focused on practical, reproducible documentation.

**Who?** A Cloud Operations Engineer with a background in telecommunications and cloud infrastructure.

**What?** Real-world guides on installing, configuring, and running tools I actually use.

**Why?** To maintain a personal reference and share knowledge with others on a similar path.

## 🎯 Site Goals

- Document **how to install, configure, and run** the tools that matter
- Keep content practical, reproducible, and opinionated when needed
- Serve as both a personal knowledge base and reference for others

## 🛠️ Homelab Overview

The guides on this site are tested on real hardware. Here's what powers this operation:

- **Intel NUC** running Proxmox for virtualization
- **Raspberry Pi 5** with M.2 NVMe and PoE+ support
- **PoE Network Switch** for infrastructure connectivity
- **Touch Screen Dashboard** for real-time monitoring
- Custom 3D-printed rackmount accessories

## 🚀 Getting Started

Visit [notestack.dev](https://notestack.dev) to browse the guides.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and uses a modified theme for documentation.
